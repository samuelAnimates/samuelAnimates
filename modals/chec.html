				<h3>Implications for Future Work</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The timeline of work in community reserach partnerships can be a hurdle to maintaining satisfaction on all sides. A more iterative process of research + dissemination could be a facilitator, as there would be less time between the start of a project and visible signs of progress.</li>
				</ul>
            </div>

			<div class="statement-block">
				<h3>Key Contributions So Far</h3>
