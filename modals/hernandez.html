					<h3>Key Question:</h3>
					<p>How do I use documntary methods in a fictional animation to help present some of the gritty details of life as a LAtinx first-generation college student?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="recognition-block">
					<h3>Current Status:</h3>
					<p>Rough cut of backgroundaudio in place. Interview with first-generation community leader being edited. Animation sequences in an iterative process of production, testing, + revision.</p>

			<h3>Areas of Exploration:</h3>
			 <ul>
                 <li>How do competing priorities of self, family, community, and career affect personal outlooks on career paths for first-generation college students?</li>
				 <li>How can I use mixed methods to effectively document the life of a fictional character?</li>
                 <li>How do I use this fictional character as an entry point to discussions of the issues that minortized populations in smaller US cities face?</li>

			<h3>Background:</h3>
			<p>I'm interested in exploring the experience of first-generation college students like myself and many of my friends. The feeling of isolation on-campus is relatively easy for me to describe, compared to the feeling of competing interests that can kick in after graduation. Family, community, self, and career can create a wide set of priorities, and it can be hard to feel like any choice is right. It can feel like making progress in one area takes time and energy away from another. I want to use the story of a Latina astronaut drifting off into space to help me organize my own thoughts about what I prioritize in my own life, and what lessons I might be able to bring into my future work.</p>

			<h3>Process:</h3>
			<p>For this film, I am imagining the unfinished business my main chracter might have left on earth as she drifts off into space. Despite her accomplishments, what personal dreams did she not actualize? What relationships does she wish she could turn to? What problems does she still want to solve?</p>
