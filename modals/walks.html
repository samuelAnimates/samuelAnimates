					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<br>
					<p>A public art installation in Harvard Yard, focusing on the experience transitioning to life on Harvard's campus and entering the "Harvard Bubble".</p>
				</div>
				<div class="recognition-block">
					<h3>Context</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="recognition-text">Supported by an ARTS FIRST '11 grant from Harvard's Office for the Arts.<br>Made possible by the participation of: Jake, Cherish, Robert, Khin, and Dipona.<br>Thank you.</p>

			<h3>Questions I Set Out to Answer:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>How can I use physical space to guide people through a specific thought process, when I have them as a captive audience + when I don't?</li>
				<li>How can I represent the major themes of a group's lived experiences, + make them accessible to others?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I took a few groups of participants on a 30-minute silent walk in one direction, away from the freshman dorms of Harvard Yard. Afterwards, I interviewed them about their experience on the walk, as well as their experience adjusting to life on campus. I then compiled key quotes and major themes to write their experiences into two paragraphs. I divided the text into sentences on yard signs so viewers would read one line at a time as they walked along a path within Harvard Yard.</p>

			<h3></h3>
			<p>It was sunny and warm as we walked straight past the Northwest Labs, to places we’ve never seen—it was a little amazing. Walking eventually became automatic, like riding a train looking at the scenery. Past the cobblestone and buildings with character is a different world in an actual neighborhood. The whole time I felt like I was in one of those movies where the main character goes to an alternate universe: they can see/hear everything going on, but they can’t interact with it.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I liked Cambridge immediately: the college town experience, with Boston right there as an option as well. But it doesn’t feel much different from Ann Arbor, aside from a big city right there. It feels less real somehow. I guess because the Square is filled with shops and boutiques, not like a big grocery store or something. Maybe it’s just because I haven’t explored Cambridge or maybe I don’t use it as a real town. In some ways I feel like living somewhere is supposed to mean grocery shopping. But I mean I don’t know what that means if I’m not living here.</p>

			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>To be honest, this project was motivated by a sense of isolation during my first year at Harvard. As many other first-gneration college students can attest to, the campus of an "elite" institution can be a very isolating place. I felt myself becoming disconnected from things going on at home, without a sense of belonging in my new place of residence to try to make up for it. I started going on walks to help remind myself of my own power in the situation. Each time I chose to go on a long walk was a chance to remind myself of the entire world going on outside of Harvard's sphere of influence. Each time I walked back was a chance to remind myself that I was making a continuous choice to stay and pursue my passions there, a power over my own path.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I took on this project to share this process with others; through opening up with other people in this way, I learned I wasn't alone in feeling this way. I hope that by putting this project on display in Harvard Yard, I was able to help others come to the same conclusion.</p
