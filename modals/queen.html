			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>If I were to remake this film, I would use a much more iterative process. Though there are a lot of moments I'm proud of in this film, I limited it as a whole by not allowing room for discovery and spontaneity in the filmmaking process. What started as a narrative short could've become a much more satisfying abstract film if I had let it.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I limited myself by thinking that I had to chart out a path and follow it precisely to successfully finish making a short film. Now, I know that I can follow an iterative process of test sequences, feedback, editing, and background research to allow mroe breathing room for lessons I might learn along the way toward completing a film.</p>
