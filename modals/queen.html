			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>This film contains a lot of moments I'm very proud of, from the sound design of the introduction to the stylized first-person movement made purely out of 2D digital cutouts. And as my first longer-term animation project, <span class="inline-title">Snow Queen Travel Company</span> also holds a special place in my life story.</p>
			<br>
			<p>However, I'm also proud to say that I would follow a completely different process if I were making this film today. At the age of 19, I was too concerned with making an animation the "right" way, in a waterfall process from A to Z, editing carefully plotted out scenes into a concise narrative. I was also too averse to showing vulnerability + honesty, and avoided sharing my work-in-progress with others. In my work since then, I have followed a more iterative process, using small-scale experiments as an opportunity to try out an idea I'm not sure about, garnering feedback, and creating something new based off of what I learned.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I do feel I missed an opportunity in this film by not being open enough with my works-in-progress, while also trying (and somewhat failing) to wedge my experimental animation into a narrative structure. But I also feel proud of this film not just because of what it taught me, but also because I can look at it and see enthusiastic exploration of themes/motifs I am exploring to this day. The first-person movement that played a central role in [<a href="./busan.html" class="inline-title">By Foot: Busan and the Sea</a>] and [<a href="./saigon.html" class="inline-title">10 Days in Saigon</a>]; the disembodied, controlling narrator also used in [<a href="./breakfast.html" class="inline-title">Persefone's Breakfast</a>]; my focus on places + environments; a willingness to blur boundaries + follow unexpected paths that I strive for in all of my work.</p>
