			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>This film taught me a lot about the importance of seeking out feedback early and often, as well as the value not trying to squeeze a square peg into a circle. This film contains a lot of moments I very proud of—in fact I still say that this film's introduction is the best thing I've made. As my first major undertaking made as something more than university project, this film also holds a special place in my heart.</p>
			<br>
			<p>However, I'm also proud to say that I would follow a completely different process if I were aking this film today. I was inspired to make this film while attending the Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film. I felt the undeniable spark to make the kind of work I had never seen before, and had the idea for the walking scene of this film, inspired by Kelly Link's writing.</p>
