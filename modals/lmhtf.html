					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<br>
					<p>An introductory video for a public health program by the [ <a href="http://www.mhtflawrence.org/" target="_blank" class="inline-title"> Mayor's Health Task Force</a>], for use in meetings with potential stakeholders.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="recognition-block">
					<h3>Context</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="recognition-text">Made for community partners at the [<a href="http://viswanathlab.org/" target="_blank" class="inline-title">Viswanath Lab</a>] while working on my senior thesis film [<a href="./bodega.html" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>].</p>

			<h3>Implications for Future Work</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>By being proactive in communication with community partners, it's possible to respond to timeline changes in ways that still meet the needs of all partners.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I started off the process of making [<a href="./bodega.html" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>] with the aim of making a documentary about a public health program by the Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force (MHTF). They were starting a new program focused on helping corner stores stock fresh/frozen prodce, as well host cooking demos and excerises classes, to create an environment of health around local resources. I visited bodegas and sat in on meetings with the MHTF, recording interviews and documentary footage along the way.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The timeline of the MHTF project ended up not aligning with my own timeline for finishing my thesis film and graduating from college. However, there was still a need for a tool to help explain the MHTF's goals + engage potential stakeholders around their corner store project. So, I worked on this video while finishing my thesis as a part of our partnership.</p>
