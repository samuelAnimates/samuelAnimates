					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<br>
					<p>An introductory video for a public health program by the [ <a href="http://www.mhtflawrence.org/" class="inline-title"> Mayor's Health Task Force</a>], for use in meetings with potential stakeholders.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="recognition-block">
					<h3>Context</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="recognition-text">Made for community partners at the [<a href="./viswanath.html" class="inline-title">Viswanath Lab</a>] while working on my senior thesis film [<a href="./bodega.html" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>].</p>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I actually started off the process of making [<a href="./bodega.html" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>] as a documentary about a public health program by the Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force (MHTF). They were starting a great program focused on helping corner stores stock fresh/frozen prodce, as well host cooking demos and excerises classesâ€”all to create an environment of health around local resources. I visited bodegas and sat in on meetings with the MHTF, recording interviews and documentary footage along the way.</p>
			<br>
			<p>However, the timeline of the MHTF project ended up not aligning with my own timeline for finishing my thesis film and graduating from college. There was still a need for a tool to help explain the MHTF's goals + engage potential stakeholders. So, I worked on this video while finishing my thesis as a way to honor my commitments to our partnership.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
			<p>Though I had contributed to the relathionships with community partners while working at the [<a href="./viswanath.html" class="inline-title">Viswanath Lab</a>], this my first time leading community partner engagement on a project. I felt honored by the MHTF and the Viswanath Lab members' eagerness to help me grow through this experience, trying to create a project that would satisfy my thesis committee, my lab members, the MHTF + their partners all at once.</p>
			<br>
			This process didn't play out exactly as I had planned, and I ended up producing two products I am very proud of as a result.
