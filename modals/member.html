			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p>Create a short bilingual promotional video introducing the [<a href="http://spanishcenter.org/" class="inline-title">Spanish Community Center</a>] (SCC) to potential donors and community members.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>My Role</h3>
			<p>Developed the concept and went on-site to record interviews conducted by SCC volunteers. Worked with the Executive Director to frame the community and staff experience within the broad scope of essential services offered by the organization.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>I chose to take this on as a volunteer project because of the amazing and necessary work that the SCC does for the Joliet community. Just a few words into conversation with staff, volunteers, or leadership, and you can see just how dedicated this group is to serving the significant, but often ignored, Spanish-speaking population of Will County, IL.</p>
