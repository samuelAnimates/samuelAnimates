					<h3>Key Finding:</h3>
					<p>Animation can be effectively applied as an observational documentary technique. It can be used to focus on individual details + individual human-scale movement through an environment, simultaneously documenting a personal experience + the physical environment it took place in.<p>

					<h3>Recognition</h3>
					<p class="recognition-text">Official Latino Short Film Festival, Exceptional Artistry award nomination, New York, NY, 2017.</p>

			<h3>Implications for future work:</h3>
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Animation as a documentary method can lower the audience barrier to works that don't focus on human subjects or narrative storytelling.</li>
				<li>Animation as a documentary method allows for a focus on physical environments that might otherwise be less engaging through more traditional documentary methods.</li>
				<li>Animation as a documentary method can convery a personal experience without setting up an audience expectation for a moral or educational lesson that often comes with traditional documentary methods.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Background:</h3>
			<p>This film came out of a desire to apply animation as an observational documentary method, without the use of a narrator or other framing devices to give the film a familiar structure found in narrative films.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="statement-block">
			<h3>Process:</h3>
			<p>Despite its energetic pace, this film required a lot of slow, purposeful movement. Sometimes that meant taking a few steps, snapping a photo, and repeating until I got tired. Other times, that meant using a sound recorder to listen carefully to the environment around me, chasing down a soundscape that felt unique to that specific part of the city. Other times, it meant doubling back over my path to take photos of interesting recurring patterns in the environment I noticed through my slow walking. Sometimes I went into the day with a plan for my photograpghy, based off of online research or passing by the location earlier. Many days, I used a process of forward animation, in which spontaneity ruled as a I animted one step ata time without a predetermined path.</p>
