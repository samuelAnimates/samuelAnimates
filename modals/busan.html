			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I made this film while living out of a hostel, fresh from leaving a job, with no idea of what I was going to do next.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Every day I got up, packed up my equipment into a bright orange backpack, and took the bus/subway to somewhere new in the city. Sometimes I went into the day with a plan for my photograpghy, based off of online research or passing by the location earlier. More often, I decided to take each visit one step at a time.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Despite its energetic pace, this film required a lot of slow, purposeful movement. Sometimes that meant taking a few steps, snapping a photo, and repeating until I got tired. Other times, that meant using a sound recorder to listen carefully to the environment around me, chasing down a soundscape that felt unique to that specific part of the city. Other times, it meant doubling back over my path to take photos of interesting recurring patterns in the environment I noticed through my slow walking.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In the end, this film turned into an ode to solo travel, and a reminder from my past self to pay more attention to the spaces I'm in. It also put the fire in my belly to keep exploring animation as a documentary method, and discover ways to put the power of reflective art and documentary into more people's hands</p>
			<br>
			<p>Thank you to Andrew Blad for the drum recordings I turned into a backing track.<br>Thank you to the new friends, old friends, and kind strangers who helped make this film possible.</p>
