			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I appreciate how animation methods emphasize motion and design over speech/text; I wanted to leverage this to highlight the ways that experimental animation can document life stories where spoken language falls short. I chose scars + tattoos as my focus, because of their own visual language that typically serves as shorthand reminders for people's life stories.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I started off by reaching out to friends, friends-of-friends, and listservs to find people with tattoos/scars that had a story behind them. I ended up interviewing 3 people on camera and making several trips to a tattoo parlor to film the tattoo process, as well as an interview with the artist. After transcribing the interviews and putting together multiple combinations of the footage, I discovered the final format of this film. I was interested in the similarities of two subjects' verbal storytelling, as well as some of the common themes in their vastly different stories.</p>
			<br>
			<p> I started with sound editing, trimming down their interview audio and finding points of similar filler words and hesitations between the two. After finishing the audio of the film, I approached the video editing with the goal of highlighting how the design and movement of these marks tell parts of the subjects' stories better than they could with spoken words alone.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Thank you to all of the participants, featured and unfeatured, who made this film possible.<br>Thank you to Alfred Guzzetti, George Olken, and my VES 52r classmates.</p>
