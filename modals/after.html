					<h3>Key Finding</h3>
					<p>Experimental video takes on some qualities of animation, and using animation's frame-by-frame approach to filmmaking can aid in editing in crating a cohesive work.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="recognition-block">
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p class="recognition-text">Inpsired by nontraditional documentaries, this film started my experimentation with animation as a way of challenging the common notion that only archival footage, infographics, and an expert opinion make for accurate nonfiction.</p>

			<h3>Key Findings:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Animation's emphasis on motion + design can be a useful tool for documenting tattoos, scars, and other such subjects with similar design- and motion-centered attirubtes.</li>
				<li>Experimental documentary allows for the subject to guide the shape of the final product.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Background:</h3>
			<p>This film was inspired by animated documentaries like Chris Landreth's <span class="inline-title">Ryan</span> and Jonathon Hodgson's <span class="inline-title">Feeling My Way</span>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="statement-block">
			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I started off by reaching out through personal contacts and listservs to find people with tattoos/scars that had a story behind them. I ended up interviewing 3 people on camera and making several trips to a tattoo parlor to film the tattoo process (and an interview with the artist). After transcribing the interviews and putting together multiple combinations of the footage, I discovered the final format of this film. I was interested in the similarities of two subjects' verbal storytelling, as well as some of the common themes in their vastly different stories. I started with sound editing these two interviews. After finishing the audio of the film, I approached the video editing with the goal of highlighting some of the features of the marks that were highlighted by the interviewees. This was important in documenting these stories, in which the physical marks played a narrative role where theinterviewees couldn't rely on spoken words alone.</p>
