					<h3>Key Finding:</h3>
					<p>Like many of my animations, this one takes the viewer on a guided journey. However, this one differs in its aggressive insistence on reminding the viewer that the main character is controlling the direction + pace of the story for their own benefit. The result is jarring, and potentially alienating.</p>

			<h3>Implications for future work:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Personal views on interconnected topics of social equity can be organized around a familiar narrative framework, such as a myth.</li>
				<li>Taken all at once, many different media representations of an environment can convey a central emotional perception of it, though specific details of the environment are easily lost.</li>
				<li>Color is an effective way of linking distinct pieces of a work that otherwise might seem disconnected.</li>

			<h3>Background:</h3>
			<p>The idea for this film came during the making of [<a href="./bodega.html" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>], giving me a space to explore my own anger around issues of food deserts, which didn't fit in that previous film. Communities in food deserts are denied access to both longterm health and to aspects of their cultural identity; when they can't buy ingredients to make the food that's been made for generations, they're missing out on a key experience of their own story. While [<a href="../films/bodega.html" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>] highlighted resources that minortizied communities have built up for themselves, <span class="inline-title">Persefone's Breakfast</span> refashions the Persephone myth to explore what it could look like to opt out of oppressive systems entirely.</p>

			<h3>Process:</h3>
			<p>The filmmaking process started with the creation of a 3D model of the Underworld, depicted as a sort of modern metropolis. From there, text sequences were made to imagine what media tools might be used in such a world to force an identity on Perspehone: maps, newsreels, food, statistical figures and more. An iterative process of writing, animating test sequences, recording audio, editing rouch cuts and garnering feedback was used to discover the film's final shape. Voice messages were chosen as a way to give Persefone control over her story again, as she completely dictates the pace of the film, even leaving the listener on hold as she rejects the narrative the Underworld has forced on her and uses food to leave it behind once and for all.</p>
