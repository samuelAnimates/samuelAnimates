					<h3>Synopsis</h3>
					<p>"We're talking, and you're listening." Persefone leaves a series of voice messages for Hades as she prepares to leave the Underworld — once and for all. This experimental animation uses mythology + food to explore issues of identity and inequity in today's cities as Persefone takes control of her fate in an Underworld city that was never designed for her.</p>

					<h3>Process</h3>
					<p>I started this filmmaking process with one goal: give my main character complete control over the audience's experience. I went through an iterative process of writing, garnering feedback, filming/animating test sequences, recording audio, and stitching the pieces together to make that happen over the course of a year. My first film made outside of a university setting, the logistic process of making this animation taught me a lot about DIY stop-motion setups, finding a recording studio, auditioning voice actors, and ignoring my fear of roaches as I animated food under a DSLR in my apartment. I ended up recording the audio and stop-motion sequences shortly after moving to Shanghai, and had to quickly learn how to connect with other artists in this setting in order to finish making <span class="inline-title">Persefone's Breakfast</span></p>

					<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
					<p>I chose to depict the Underworld as a modern metropolis, and I used a wide array of media to visualize how such an Underworld would force an identity on Persefone: newsreels, maps, statistics, urban design, and food. I chose voice messages as the means to give my main character complete control over the situation, coming and going as she pleases, leaving the listener to imagine what's going on when she hangs up, walks away, or even puts them on hold.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I approached this animation as a sister film to <a href="../films/bodega.html" target="_blank" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>. While making that film, I was angry at how communities in food deserts are denied access to both longterm health and aspects of their cultural identity: if community members can't buy ingredients to make the food that's been made for generations, they're missing out on a key experience of their own story. While <span class="inline-title">A Bodega</span> highlighted resources that minortizied communities have built up for themselves in spite of oppressive systems, <span class="inline-title">Persefone's Breakfast</span> refashions the Persephone myth to explore what it could look like to opt out of oppressive systems entirely. If Hades used his food to trap Persephone in the Underworld, could she use her own food to free herself? Could she use the knowledge from her homeworld to refuse the identity that the Underworld has forced on her? Making this film taught me a lot about my own views of the power of everyday individual actions.</p>
