					<h3>Synopsis</h3>
					<p>"We're talking, and you're listening." Persefone leaves a series of voice messages for Hades as she prepares to leave the Underworld — once and for all. This experimental animation uses mythology + food to explore issues of identity and inequity in today's cities, as Persefone takes control of her fate in a world that was never designed for her.</p>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I started making this film with one goal in mind: give my main character complete control over the audience's experience. I worked through an iterative process of writing, filming/animating test sequences, recording audio, stitching pieces together, garnering feedback, and rewriting over the course of a year to do just that.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I chose to depict the Underworld as a modern metropolis, and I used a wide array of media to visualize how such a city could force an identity on Persefone: newsreels, maps, statistics, urban design, and food. I chose voice messages as the means to give Persefone complete control over the situation, coming and going as she pleases, leaving the listener to imagine what's going on when she hangs up, walks away, or even puts them on hold.</p>
			<br>
			<p>My first film made outside of a university setting, this animation taught me a lot about DIY stop-motion setups, finding a recording studio, auditioning voice actors, and ignoring my fear of roaches as I animated food under a DSLR in my apartment. I ended up recording the audio and stop-motion sequences shortly after moving to Shanghai, and had to quickly learn how to connect with other artists in this setting in order to finish making <span class="inline-title">Persefone's Breakfast</span></p>
			<br>
			<p>I approached this animation as a sister film to [<a href="../films/bodega.html" target="_blank" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>], giving myself a chance to explore my own anger about how communities in food deserts are denied access to both longterm health and to aspects of their cultural identity; when they can't buy ingredients to make the food that's been made for generations, they're missing out on a key experience of their own story. While [<a href="../films/bodega.html" target="_blank" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>] highlighted resources that minortizied communities have built up for themselves, <span class="inline-title">Persefone's Breakfast</span> refashions the Persephone myth to explore what it could look like to opt out of oppressive systems entirely.</p>
