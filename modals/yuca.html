				<h3>Key Finding:</h3>
				<p>The combination of animation and music can help guide viewers through a process they may not have even been aware of before. The familiar structure of music combined with animation's suspension of disbelief highlights interesting opportunities for structuring information like a music video.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="recognition-block">
				<h3>Context</h3>
				<p>This film was made possible with the support of Harvard VES, the guidance of Ruth Lingford, the music of J. Andrés Ballesteros, and the yuca from Bonanza Market.</p>

			<h3>Implications for Future Work:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Animation incentivizes its creators to break down a process into small, distinct steps.</li>
				<li>Animation can help bridge language barriers.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I started off by shopping for yuca in Lawrence, MA, at a bodega that has filled a local need by selling fresh + frozen produce in a food desert. I then practiced making yuca frita and, after feeling confident in my cooking, I made three batches of yuca to transition between on-screen: raw, boiled, and completely cooked. I then took these batches to the studio to make a frame-by-frame animation overnight in one fell swoop.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I had recently been having a lot of fun and surprisingly good results allowing some elements of spontaneity into my stop-motion food animation. So, I decided to go all in on spontaneity for this short. Knowing only that the yuca had to be peeled, chopped, boiled, fried, and served on-screen, I gathered the necessary props and made up the scene as I went along.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I originally thought this animation would make up one scene in [<a href="../films/bodega.html" target="_blank" class="inline-title">A Bodega</a>], but found myself trying to squeeze it in where it didn't fit—I took it as a good sign that I had to cut out pieces of the project I loved individually. So, after finishing that film, I went back into this scene, fleshing it out with sound, music, + an introduction/ending.</p>
