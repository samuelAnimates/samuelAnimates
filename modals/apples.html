			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p>Working in a team of 6 over the course of ~2 weeks, create an application using MVC architecture, database queries, and a technology new to us at the time. We created a multiplayer party game designed for player's hand to be displayed on a phone screen, with a main game "table" displayed on a central laptop screen + socket.io facilitating two-way connection between machines.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>My Role</h3>
			<p>Co-designed the database + wrote the overall game logic. Backend developer focusing on the user story on the "table" screen, tracking the progress of the game, + sending signals to each player's machine to permit ineractions at the right time in the game.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>This was a whirlwind project we're all extremely proud of: our first multiplayer web app deployed to heroku, all with a cohesive mobile-ready frontend design. I wrote our ORM, controller, and router files necessary for retrieving cards from a database, before moving on to the actual game logic. This side of the backend development was filled with a lot of fun puzzles, trying to figure out efficient ways to divide the game logic between player devices in order to reduce the overall number of server calls + the amount of data shuttled back and forth. Given our short time frame, we all ended up pitching in to fix front and backend bugs as they popped up. So, I also created our SVG logo to make the front-end display a little more efficient.</p>
