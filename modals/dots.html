			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I designed and printed a connect-the-dots banner to hang in two public bathrooms. After hanging them up on the walls and providing pens, I let the particpants shape what installation turned into.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>This project came from seeing firsthand a lack of handwashing in this very busy bathroom in a centrally-located Harvard dorm. Given the fact that were already signs reminding people to wash their hands, I created a way to remind people they had entered a shared space. Their current environment was shaped by by many others' contributionsto to it before them, and the viewer's current actions will shape the environment for the next person who enters.</p>
