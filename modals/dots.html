			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>I designed and printed a connect-the-dots banner to hang in two public bathrooms. After hanging them up on the walls and providing pens, I let the particpants shape the installation over the course of 2 weeks.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>This project came from seeing firsthand a lack of handwashing in this very busy bathroom in a centrally-located Harvard dorm. Given the fact that were already signs reminding people to wash their hands, I created a way to remind people that they were in a shared space. Their current environment was shaped by by many others' interactions with it before them, and their own actions will shape the environment for the next person who enters.</p>
