			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p>complete a pilot test (with very limited equipment/budget) for an interview series with Chinese students enrolled in US colleges, aimed to provide more localized college information for an audience of Chinese high schoolers and their parents. Project completed as part of a beta version of the website WhyUEdu, later transferred, edited and re-branded under [<a src="http://i.youku.com/i/UMzA0NDE4NDUwOA==/videos">ShenQing.me</a>].</p>
			<br>
			<h3>My Role</h3>
			<p>Came up with the concept of having videos from current students as a free resource to encourage students + parents to make an accoune on the company's website. Led a team of 4 to develop the project's focus and write interview questions. Coordinated with local participants and scheduled travel for 2-3 staff members to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenzhen, and Beijing for filming. Instructed staff members on operating the recording equipment; sole sound/video recorder in all cities except Shanghai. Organized a team of 10 to annotate/correct Chinese interview transcripts.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>A completed set of 36 interviews recorded across a 10-day period. Effective instructions and division of labor for turning transcripts into subtitle files (written for employees with no background in video production). A workflow to correct subtitles and embed them in abridged interview videos. Detailed process notes for the director of the next phase of the video project, highlighting project strengths and opportunities for improvement. 36 subtitled and abridged interview videos with rough-cut video/sound editing, completed over 10 weeks.</p>
