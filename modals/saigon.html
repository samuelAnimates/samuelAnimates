				<h3>Overview:</h3>
				<p>An original travel series docmenting wheelchair travel in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, also known as Saigon. Local friends take us around the city, and each site visit ends with a look at what makes each place wheelchair accessibleâ€”or not.</p>

			<h3>Questions I Set Out to Answer:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>What would it look like if wheelchair accessibility wasn't treated as a niche interest?</li>
				<li>What could nuanced mainstream representation of a wheelchair user look like? What topics can we start to cover if we don't default to "inspiration porn"?</li>
				<li>How can we give people insight into the extra problems wheelchair users have to solve when they navigate cities that weren't designed with ALL people in mind?</li>
				<li>How can we use travel to show that it's not a wheelchair that limits people, but the world built up around us?</li>
				<li>What would a travel series look like if it centered voices of local residents?</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Motivation:</h3>
			<p>This project came out of a conversation with Kunho Kim, coauthor of [<a href="http://20statesonwheels.com/" class="inline-title" target="_blank">20 States on Wheels</a>], cofounder of [<a href="http://www.wearemuui.com/en/about-us/" class="inline-title" target="_blank">Muui</a>]. We talked about his goal of "making disability sexier", creating projects that address wheelchair users' needs while showing a fuller picture of their lives than you tend to see in mass media. He wanted to figure out how to expand this work into video, to reach an audience of people who might not be looking specifically for wheelchair travel information.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I came up with the idea for a video series so straightforward, we were shocked to see that no one had done it before: let's make a travel series showing a wheelchair user hanging out in an exciting city with his friends. Let's avoid "otherizing" the city by giving the microphone to local residents. And let's avoid "otherizing" disability by highlighting first-person footage from a wheelchair user's point of view.</p>

			<h3>Process:</h3>
			<p>We scheduled days of travel with Kunho's friends in the city where he spent his teen years: Saigon, Vietnam. Everywhere we went, Kunho wore a GoPro and documented wheelchair accessibility while I record observational footage on a DSLR. We then recorded interviews with Kunho's local friends, and we edited the audio down to web-friendy snippets. From there, I edited the videos and trained remote interns to make Korean, English, + Vietnamese subtitle files for the interviews.</p>
