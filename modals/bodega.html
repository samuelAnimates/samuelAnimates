				<h3>Key Finding:</h3>
				<p>Animation is a powerful documentary tool to examine topics around social equity while bypassing some of the knee-jerk reactions that can come with statistics or personal stories.</p>

				<h3>Recognition:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="recognition-text">Chicago Onscreen: Local Film Showcase, official selection, Chicago Park District, 2017.</li>
					<li class="recognition-text">Chicago REEL Shorts Film Festival, Best Documentary nomination, Chicago, IL, 2014.</li>

			<h3>Implications for future work:</h3>
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Leveraging animation can carve out a space for discussions of food access + social equity where they might not typically arise.</li>
				<li>Taking a resource-focused look at issues of social inequity (such as food deserts) can shed light on opportunities to support solutions, as opposed to focusing on the disparity.</li>
				<li>Experimental documentary can weave together several distinct modes of communication to provide a comprehensive record of a social issue in a specific geographic context.</li>
				<li>Animation can help make experimental film more accessible to wider audiences; it can lower the audience barrier to projects taking advantage of non-narrative modes of communication.</li>

			<h3>Background:</h3>
			<p>Lawrence is a city in which most residents live in a food desert; it is typiclly discussed in a negative light in Massachusetts. Bodegas, too, are often discussed in a negative light when it comes to the kind of food they sell. Social issues like food acces are often discussed in terms of what's lacking in a particular geographic locationâ€”what outside help is needed to affect change? An asset-focused look at thie issue of limited food access in this Lawrence, MA, is needed to highlight existing opportunities for change within the city, and to give proper credit to local residents for their current achievements in addressing this issue, despite systemic hurdles that produce food access issues across the country. I decided to explore what this could look like through my thesis film, <span class="inline-title">A Bodega</span>.<p>

			<h3>Process:</h3>
			<p>Over the course of 3 months, observational documentary footage was filmed at several bodegas in Lawrence, MA, that sell fresh/frozen produce. An interview was conducted with members of the Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force and the owners of one such bodega, around the topic of food access + the food for sale in this small business.  Over the course of 6 months, stop-motion animation sequences were used to document the food for sale at the bodega, illustrate dishes representative of those that local residents might make out of the ingredients there, and the gerographic context of bodega within the city. Through an iterative process of animation, editing, and critique, some segments were dropped from the film and others chosen to expand on until the final shape of the film was formed.<p>
