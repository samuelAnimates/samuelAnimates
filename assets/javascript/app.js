I ended up interviewing 3 people on camera and making several trips to a tattoo parlor to film the tattoo process, as well as an interview with a tattoo artist. After transcribing the interviews and putting together multiple combinations of the footage, I discovered the final format of this film. I was interested in the similarities of two subjects' verbal storytelling, as well as some of the common themes in their vastly different stories. I started with sound editing on these two interviews. Then, I eited the video to underscore the features of the marks that the interviewees focused on. This was important in documenting these stories, in which the physical marks played a narrative role where theinterviewees couldn't rely on spoken words alone."

This side of the backend development was filled with a lot of fun puzzles, trying to figure out efficient ways to divide the game logic between player devices in order to reduce the overall number of server calls + the amount of data shuttled back and forth. Given our short time frame, we all ended up pitching in to fix front and backend bugs as they popped up. So, I also created our SVG logo to make the front-end display a little more efficient. Thank you to my teammates Amanda Gault, Jordan Peart, Gowri Rajasekaran, Max Rashes, & Bex Way."

Much of their influence comes from the relationships they have with community members and other key stakeholders and they may be able to harness the power of social media tools to develop and maintain these relationships. There are limited data describing if and how CBOs are using social media. This study assesses the extent to which CBOs engaged in health promotion use popular social media channels, the types of content typically shared, and the extent to which the interactive aspects of social media tools are utilized.<br/><br/>We assessed the social media presence and patterns of usage of CBOs engaged in health promotion in Boston, Lawrence, and Worcester, Massachusetts. We coded content on three popular channels: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. We used content analysis techniques to quantitatively summarize posts, tweets, and videos on these channels, respectively. For each organization, we coded all content put forth by the CBO on the three channels in a 30-day window. Two coders were trained and conducted the coding. Data were collected between November 2011 and January 2012.<br/><br/>A total of 166 organizations were included in our census. We found that 42% of organizations used at least one of the channels of interest. Across the three channels, organization promotion was the most common theme for content (66% of posts, 63% of tweets, and 93% of videos included this content). Most organizations updated Facebook and Twitter content at rates close to recommended frequencies. We found limited interaction/engagement with audience members.<br/><br/>Much of the use of social media tools appeared to be uni-directional, a flow of information from the organization to the audience. By better leveraging opportunities for interaction and user engagement, these organizations can reap greater benefits from the non-trivial investment required to use social media well. Future research should assess links between use patterns and organizational characteristics, staff perspectives, and audience engagement."

The whole time I felt like I was in one of those movies where the main character goes to an alternate universe: they can see/hear everything going on, but they can‚Äôt interact with it.<br/><br/>I liked Cambridge immediately: the college town experience, with Boston right there as an option as well. But it doesn‚Äôt feel much different from Ann Arbor, aside from a big city right there. It feels less real somehow. I guess because the Square is filled with shops and boutiques, not like a big grocery store or something. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I haven‚Äôt explored Cambridge or maybe I don‚Äôt use it as a real town. In some ways I feel like living somewhere is supposed to mean grocery shopping. But I mean I don‚Äôt know what that means if I‚Äôm not living here.",

I then practiced making yuca frita and, after feeling confident in my cooking, I made three batches of yuca to transition between on-screen: raw, boiled, and completely cooked. I then took these batches to the studio to make a frame-by-frame animation overnight in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>I originally thought this animation would make up one scene in '<a href='../modals/bodega.html' target='_blank' >A Bodega</a>', but found myself trying to squeeze it in where it didn't fit‚ÄîI took it as a good sign that I had to cut out scenes I loved individually. So, after finishing that film, I went back into this scene, fleshing it out with sound, music, an introduction,and an ending."
